Repo for JHU Coursera Practical Machine Learning - Final Project
Based on a data set generously provided by HAR (available at http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) I will try to predict the manner in which users of fitness trackers (i.e.,Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, Fitbit etc.) work out and, particularly, how well they do it. This is the "classe" variable in the training set. I will explore the importance as well as the impact of other variables in the training set on the outcome variable by training a prediction model. I will afterwards apply my model to the 20 test cases in the testing data set.

The training data for this project is available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-training.csv
The testing data for this project is available here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/predmachlearn/pml-testing.csv

To sum up, I will undertake the following steps:
1. Loading data 
2. Preprocessing data for future prediction
3. Training prediction model by applying different methods and comparing their accuracy
4. Prediction of the testing data set
